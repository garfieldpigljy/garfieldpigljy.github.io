abstract: As the core of task-oriented dialogue systems, dialogue state tracking (DST)
  is designed to track the dialogue state through the conversation between users and
  systems. Multi-domain DST has been an important challenge in which the dialogue
  states across multiple domains need to consider. In recent mainstream approaches,
  each domain and slot are aggregated and regarded as a single query feeding into
  attention with the dialogue history to obtain domain-slot specific representations.
  In this work, we propose disentangled domain-slot attention for multi-domain dialogue
  state tracking. The proposed approach disentangles the domain-slot specific information
  extraction in a flexible and context-dependent manner by separating the query about
  domains and slots in the attention component. Through a series of experiments on
  MultiWOZ 2.0 and MultiWOZ 2.4 datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach
  outperforms the standard multi-head attention with aggregated domain-slot query.
